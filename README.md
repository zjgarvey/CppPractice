# CppPractice

A repository containing small C++ projects for practice. 

dirgraph.cpp is a graph building program.

- takes terminal inputs and generates a dynamically shaped graph
- nodes can be added or removed
- can find the shortest path between two existing nodes

tictactoe.cpp is a tictactoe game.

- takes inputs from a terminal and prints the gameboard at each iteration
- can be bigger than a 3x3 board

median.cpp is a typical practice problem of finding the median.

- it uses a fun algorithm
- the computation time has some interesting properties
